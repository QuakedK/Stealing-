# Platinum+Optimizer skidded Oneclick on their new release!

# Admin Check.
By default, this specific piece of code isn't necessarily a big deal because all it does is admin check, and a lot of people have admin checks in their code. However, the issue is whether or not they stole it. Now paired with all the other things that they stole from OneClick, you can definitely tell this was stolen and not written on their own. They even stole the format, so much so that the stars I included for visual purposes were seen in the code.

# Telementry Code.
This telemetry code is problematic because it's ordered exactly the same, but when you actually look into it the entire code format is the same. Even including the disable of core isolation, or even the submit sample consent.

# Intel & AMD Services.
I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to say in terms of this Intel and AMD services code. It's a one for one copy, and the argumentation I'm hearing is "well the only thing is, it's ordered the same." But they even included the idea for the AMD services to be checked before disabled. Therefore, you wouldn't have unnecessary registry changes to AMD services you didn't even have.

# Graphics Preferences, Priority and FSO.
This one is arguably the most blatant one because not only does it loop exactly 48 games, which the Oneclick code actually sets and defines as variables, but it uses the same variables in terms of the registry keys.
Meaning it's show badly pasted, it won't even work because the 48 games, 19 other paths and the registry keys weren't defined lmao...

# Windows Processes Priority.
I mean, come on, this one is just another blatant copy. There's genuinely nothing else to add to other than it's a one-for-one copy.

# Edge Removal Code.
The reason I did this being, on Windows 24H2 and above, Windows Search explicitly uses Web2, meaning if it gets deleted, windows Search no longer works. And it was moved to the Search removal, so if someone removed Search, obviously, you wouldn't need Edge Web2 because you don't have Search anymore.
